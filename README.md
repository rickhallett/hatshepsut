Based on the requirements provided for your client, I have designed a comprehensive training program. This program takes into account her dietary needs, her fitness goals, and her specific training regimen. Here's a detailed breakdown:

## Nutrition

**Daily Intake:**
- **Calories:** 1600 kcal
- **Protein:** 161g
- **Fat:** 71g
- **Carbohydrates:** 80g

Given her omnivorous diet, you should focus on a balanced mix of lean and fatty meats, dairy, fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats to meet these macronutrient targets.

## NEAT (Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis)

- **Starting with 5000 steps per day.**
- **Increase by 250 steps daily.**

## Cold Exposure

1. Finish daily showers with 30 seconds of **cold** water. Next week, it's a minute.

## High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)

**Once Per Week:**
- 20 minutes of interval metcon (metabolic conditioning) exercises.
- This should include activities like sprinting, burpees, jump squats, etc., to achieve high breathing and work rates.
- Talk to Richard. It will be a weekly surprise. Yay.
